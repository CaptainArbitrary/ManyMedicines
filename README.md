## New Medicines

### Neolithic Medicines

#### Chicken Soup

This simple broth of meat, vegetables and medicinal herbs makes one feel better when one is sick. It starts spoiling almost immediately, though, so best consume it while it's very fresh. For reasons lost to history, this broth is universally called "chicken soup" even though it can be made from almost any ingredients.

#### Rose Petal Tea

This tea made from rose petals and medicinal herbs relieves stress, promotes good circulation and speeds healing. Its effects are quite mild, but it's free from harmful side effects so it can be consumed frequently without risk of damage or dependence.

### Industrial Medicines

#### Proxen

Proxen is a mild analgesic. Non-additive and non-tolerance-forming, but only really useful for providing partial relief from pain. Effects peak about one hour after administration, then gradually taper off over the next 11 hours. Take two to three times a day for best results.

#### Mycin

Mycin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antimicrobial that boosts the body's natural immune response to bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections. Can be administered responsively to treat infections, or prophylactically to prevent infections. Take daily for best results.

#### Lopram

Lopram is a synthetic antidepressant. When taken daily it significantly improves mood, but developing a dependence on the drug is extremely likely. Withdrawal symptoms include aches and pains, nausea, irritability, sleeplessness and depression lasting three to four days after the last dose taken. It is best to start a course of treatment with lopram only when a steady supply of the drug can be guaranteed.
