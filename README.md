Proxen is a mild analgesic. Non-additive and non-tolerance-forming, but only really useful for providing partial relief from pain. Effects peak about one hour after administration, then gradually taper off over the next 11 hours. Take two to three times a day for best results.

## Lopram

Lopram is a synthetic antidepressant. When taken daily it significantly improves mood, but developing a dependence on the drug is extremely likely. Withdrawal symptoms include aches and pains, nausea, irritability, sleeplessness and depression lasting three to four days after the last dose taken. It is best to start a course of treatment with lopram only when a steady supply of the drug can be guaranteed.
