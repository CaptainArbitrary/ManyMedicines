## New Drugs

Many Medicines adds a number of new [medical drugs](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Medical_drugs). Some are treatments for acute conditions like disease, infection or trauma; others are best used for the ongoing management of chronic conditions or personality problems. There are neolithic drugs that are available at (or close to, depending on one's mods) the start of a new game, and there are industrial drugs that have research requirements and that are more expensive to produce. Beyond that lie the spacer drugs, remarkably expensive to manufacture but potentially life-changing.

### Neolithic Drugs

These drugs are available from the start of the game with no research required, and can be crafted at either a campfire or a crafting spot with no minimum skills.

#### Chicken Soup

    </td>
    <td>This simple broth of meat, vegetables and medicinal herbs makes one feel better when one is sick. It starts spoiling almost immediately, though, so it's best consumed while it's very fresh. For reasons lost to history, this broth is universally called "chicken soup" even though it can be made from almost any ingredients.</td>

# FAQ

### Can I add this mod to a save game?

Yes. No problem.

### Can I remove this mod from a save game?

I wouldn't advise it, as a general rule. If you really want to, start by backing up your saves, then get rid of all the mod-added items in your game and make sure none of your pawns are under the influence of any of this mod's hediffs. Then you can try removing the mod. But I can't promise to help you if this breaks your save. That's what the backup is for.

### CE?

No idea. I don't play with [Combat Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2890901044). I'd love for somebody to try it out and tell me.

### Can I use this with [some other mod]?

Probably. It's extremely unlikely for there to be any conflict between Many Medicines and any other mod (unless another modder decided to use the abbreviation "MMeds"). I've tested this mod with a rather large mod list and had no problems, so you probably won't either. If you do run into an incompatibility of any kind, though, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/CaptainArbitrary/ManyMedicines/issues/new) about it.
